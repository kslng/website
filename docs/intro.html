				<h1>Intro to KSL</h1>
				KSL is a language designed to be strongly typed,
				aot-compiled, and memory safe. Along with some other
				neat features like
				<a href="./attributes.html">function attributes</a>
				and pretty much whatever else seems worthy of having.
				<br><br>
				In this guide we'll briefly discuss how to get started
				programming your first project in KSL. Of course, the
				first thing you'll want to do is download the KSL
				compiler from the home page.
				<br><br>
				Next create a KSL file. You can do this with either
				<code>.k</code> or <code>.ksl</code>, for now the file
				name itself doesn't matter much. Let's get it open in
				your favourite code editor now.
				<br><br>
				Just like in other lower level programming languages,
				your program will need an entry point. For this let's
				create a <code>main()</code> function.
				<pre><code>function main() -> null {
	return;
}</code></pre>
				Alright, there's a lot going on there so let's talk
				about it. <code>function</code> clearly states that
				we're starting a new function, then the <code>main</code>
				that comes after that is the name of said function.
				Don't worry about the open and close parentheses for
				now. The little <code>-></code> symbol is what tells
				KSL the expected return type for the function, for
				our <code>main</code> function, we said the expected
				return type should be <code>null</code>, or effectively
				nothing.
				<br><br>
				Great, now we have a <code>.k</code> or <code>.ksl</code>
				file that has a function in it called <code>main</code>.
				Time to get this baby compiled! Open up your command line
				and use the following command:<br>
				<code>ksl &lt;your_file_name&gt;</code><br>
				Alternatively, just run <code>ksl</code> to see a list
				of options, build flags, and whatnot.<br><br>
				<i>At the time of this page being written KSL doesn't have
				a linking process built in, which means that it will
				return an unlinked object file that will need to be
				manually linked with a different compiler or linker.</i>
