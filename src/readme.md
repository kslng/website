# Welcome to the KSL Docs!

Hopefully you learn something useful about KSL! You can access all the pages in
the navigation menu (left side on desktop and hamburger menu icon on mobile.)

If you're just getting started, check out the [Setup Guide](./setup/)!

# Introduction

KSL is a language designed to be strongly typed, aot-compiled, fast, and memory
safe. Along with some other neat features like [function attributes](./attribute/)
and pretty much whatever else seems worthy of having.

So why should I pick KSL over another language?

- KSL is statically typed, although that can make development less fun at times,
  it catches a lot of possible runtime bugs allowing you to write safer code.
- KSL is *fast*, it uses the same compiler backend as C, C++, and Rust. In early
  testing it was slightly slower than C and faster than Rust.
- KSL is memory safe, although not as much as Rust might be, KSL does include a
  reference counting system which will take care of memory management for you!
- KSL was designed with developer experience in mind, with a beautiful and
  understandable syntax, fast compile times, rich documentation, and various
  other language features, I can say this is the best language I've ever
  developed in (with that being said I'm very baised.)
