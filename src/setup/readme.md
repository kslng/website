# Getting Started

Let's get KSL working on your device!

- [Installing KSL](./installing.md)
- [Configuring KSL](./configure.md)

Once you get KSL installed and working, try learning about some of the language!

- [Loops!](../loop/)
- [Functions!](../function/)

If you run into any problems check out the error codes documentation:

- [Error Codes](../compiler/error-codes.md)

Finally, if you already have a background in programming and just want to learn
the KSL syntax, check out the [quick syntax guide](../misc/quick-syntax.md).
