# Definition

For now, functions will be defined with the `function` keyword,
then comes the function identifier and typed parameters (inside
parenthesis). As KSL is a strongly typed language, you will also
need to define the function return type (or function derivative.)
This can be done with `->` and then the type identifier.

```c
function main(int a) -> int {
	return a;
}
```
