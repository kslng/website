# For Loops

If you're here you probably want to learn how to make a for loop in KSL.
If that's the case, welcome! Otherwise, uh, leave?

So, we want to make something interesting that expresses how KSL works.
A great idea for that would be to make a simple program that generates
a random decimal value, we'll then round that and count the number of 1's
and 0's in a sample number!

The first thing we need to do, is consider our requirements. We need to
generate a random number, round it, and we'll want to display the results
at the end. So we need `std.random`, `std.math`, and `std.io`.

Let's start our new file, you can call it whatever you want but I'll call
mine `super_epic_for_loop_example_for_the_ksl_docs_tutorial.k`! Without
further adieu, let's begin.

```c#
using std.io;
using std.math;
using std.random;
```

This should get all our needs taken care of in regards to the standard
library modules! Now we need to define our entry point.

```rust
fn main() -> int {
	return 0;
}
```

As covered in some other tutorials (hopefully) the `main` function is
the entry point and the `-> int` defines the function derivative
(basically the expected function return type, but KSL has to be
*sooooo* special.)

Now let's define our zero and one counts. By default all variables in KSL
are mutable, this is great news for us because that means we don't have
to do any extra work to update these values!

```c#
fn main() -> int {
	int zeros = 0;
	int ones = 0;
	return 0;
}
```

We've made so much progress so far! Go ahead and get a drink of water,
because this is where it gets real.

We need to add the famed for loop now.

```c#
fn main() -> int {
	int zeros = 0;
	int ones = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++;) {

	}
	return 0;
}
```

So, let's disect this a little bit. The first statement is our initializer,
we're setting the i variable to an integer with a value of 0. The next is an
expression, it's expected to be a boolean. If the value is true then it will
run again, otherwise it will move on in the program. Finally, we have the
iterative statement, the i++, which is just a shorthand to increase the variable
i by 1 in this case.

Great, that was a lot, but it only gets better from here! Let's add the random
number generation function!

```c#
fn main() -> int {
	int zeros = 0;
	int ones = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++;) {
		f64 random_float = random.rand() -> f64;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

This line of code actually covers a lot of topics in KSL, for now most of them
aren't super necessary to know. If you want to read more later check out
[inline function calls](../function/inline-calls.md), specifically inline hints.
All you need to know for this tutorial is that this is getting a random number
and saving it to the `random_float` variable, which we have set to a `f64`.

Now we need to round this value to figure out if it will be a `1` or a `0`!

We can do this with the following code, go ahead and add it after the
`random_float` variable line.

```c
int random_rounded = math.round(random_float) -> int;
```

If you've figured that out we can move on to the if statement, which will be
the part of our program that actually tells us which variable to increment
(ones or zeros, if you've already forgotten.)

```rust
if (random_rounded == 1) {
	ones++;
} else {
	zeros++;
}
```

What this is doing is checking if the `random_rounded` variable is equal to
`1`, if it is, then we increment the `ones` variable (remember that shorthand
from earlier?) Otherwise, we add `1` to the `zeros` variable. Luckily, since
the result of our random number rounding can only be `1` or `0` in this situation,
we don't have to add any other logic for counting!

If you ran this code right now it would work! But you wouldn't be able to see the
results :( and that's kind of the point of this whole thing. So, let's use our
awesome `io` module from the standard library to show our counts!

```rust
io.writeln(zeros);
io.writeln(ones);
```

Great, now it will print our counts to the console!

For those of you that don't care about learning the language and just want to
make something quickly without thinking of the potential consequences, here is
the full code:

```c#
using std.io;
using std.math;
using std.random;

fn main() -> int {
	int zeros = 0;
	int ones = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++;) {
		f64 random_float = random.rand() -> f64;
		int random_rounded = math.round(random_float) -> int;
		if (random_rounded == 1) {
			ones++;
		} else {
			zeros++;
		}
	}
	io.writeln(zeros);
	io.writeln(ones);
	return 0;
}
```

Oh yeah, if you wanted to check your work that's also good, no hate on that.
